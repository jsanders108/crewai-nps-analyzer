# CrewAI NPS Analyzer for Film Budgeting Software

## Project Objective

I developed this project to demonstrate the power of the CrewAI framework in addressing a significant pain point in market research: swiftly and efficiently analyzing large quantities of qualitative data. By leveraging multiple AI agents working together, I showcase how CrewAI can streamline the process of analyzing open-ended responses from surveys, a task that traditionally requires substantial time and effort.

The primary goals of my project are:

1. To automate the process of analyzing qualitative survey responses (in this example, an NPS survey)
2. To perform in-depth thematic analysis of open-ended feedback
3. To generate a comprehensive report with actionable insights derived from qualitative data

By achieving these objectives, I illustrate how CrewAI can significantly enhance the productivity and effectiveness of market research processes, particularly in extracting meaningful insights from unstructured text data. This approach aims to dramatically reduce the time and resources typically required for qualitative data analysis, allowing researchers to focus on strategic interpretation and decision-making rather than manual coding and categorization of responses.

## NPS Survey Background

For this project, I used mock NPS survey data for a film budgeting software program targeting Production Accountants. The survey was created to gauge initial customer satisfaction and identify areas for improvement following the software's launch.

The survey structure contained two core NPS questions:
1. Likelihood to recommend (0-10 scale)
2. Reasons for the given rating

### Survey Objectives

I centered the mock NPS survey around the following key objectives:

1. Identify Key Drivers of Satisfaction
2. Pinpoint Areas for Improvement
3. Assess Mid-range Feedback
4. Develop an Action Plan

For more detail, please visit the `nps_analysis_objectives.md` file. This document outlines the context of the survey and the specific insights I aimed to extract from the data.

## Code Walkthrough

In this project, I utilized the latest version of CrewAI, showcasing its updated features and syntax. Let me break down the key components of my implementation:

### 1. Agent Configuration (agents.yaml)

I defined the roles and responsibilities of the AI agents in the `agents.yaml` file:

```yaml
analyst:
  role: NPS Follow-up Response Analyst
  goal: Analyze qualitative data from Net Promoter Score (NPS) follow-up questions...

report_writer:
  role: NPS Insights Report Writer
  goal: Transform the analyst's findings from NPS follow-up responses into a comprehensive, professional report...
```

I assigned each agent a specific role in the analysis process, ensuring a clear division of labor and expertise.

### 2. Task Definition (tasks.yaml)

I outlined the specific tasks for each agent to perform in the `tasks.yaml` file:

```yaml
analysis_task:
  description: Analyze the NPS survey data, focusing on the responses to the follow-up question...

report_writing_task:
  description: Create a concise yet powerful and informative summary report based on the insights generated by the NPS analyst...
```

These task definitions guide the agents through the process of transforming raw NPS data into actionable insights.

### 3. Crew Assembly (crew.py)

The `crew.py` file is the heart of my CrewAI implementation, where I assembled the team of AI agents:

```python
@CrewBase
class NpsAnalyzerCrew():
    agents_config = 'config/agents.yaml'
    tasks_config = 'config/tasks.yaml'

    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.OpenAIGPT35 = ChatOpenAI(
            model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo", 
            temperature=0)
        
        self.OpenAIGPT4o = ChatOpenAI(
            model_name="gpt-4o", 
            temperature=0)

    @agent
    def analyst(self) -> Agent:
        return Agent(
            config=self.agents_config['analyst'],
            tools=[read_objectives, search_objectives, read_data, search_data],
            allow_delegation=False,
            llm=self.OpenAIGPT4o,
            verbose=True
        )
    
    # ... [similar method for report_writer]

    @crew
    def crew(self) -> Crew:
        return Crew(
            agents=self.agents,
            tasks=self.tasks,
            process=Process.sequential,
            verbose=2,
            memory=True
        )
```

In this class, I set up the agents with their respective configurations and tools, and assembled them into a crew that works sequentially to complete the analysis.

### 4. Execution (main.py)

Finally, I created a `main.py` file to kick off the entire process:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
from nps_analyzer.crew import NpsAnalyzerCrew

def run():
    NpsAnalyzerCrew().crew().kickoff()
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    run()
```

This simple script creates an instance of the `NpsAnalyzerCrew` and initiates the analysis process.

## Output Showcase

The culmination of the AI agents' work is a comprehensive markdown report (`report.md`) that provides valuable insights from the NPS questions. Here are the key highlights from the analysis:

### Executive Summary
