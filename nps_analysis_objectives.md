# Objectives: Net Promoter Score Analysis for Film Budgeting Software

## Background
Our company recently launched a new film budgeting software program targeting Production Accountants. Following market research that identified a niche opportunity, we conducted a short Net Promoter Score (NPS) survey to gauge initial customer satisfaction and identify areas for improvement.

## Survey Structure
The survey contained two core NPS questions:
1. Likelihood to recommend (0-10 scale)
2. Reasons for the given rating

## Primary Objectives

1. Identify Key Drivers of Satisfaction
   - Analyze feedback from Promoters (scores 9-10) to understand product strengths
   - Highlight the most frequently mentioned positive aspects of the software

2. Pinpoint Areas for Improvement
   - Examine feedback from Detractors (scores 0-6) to identify critical issues
   - Categorize and prioritize the most common complaints or suggestions

3. Assess Mid-range Feedback
   - Evaluate responses from Passives (scores 7-8) to uncover potential enhancements
   - Identify features or aspects that could convert Passives into Promoters

4. Action Plan Development
   - Based on the analysis, outline key areas for immediate improvement
   - Propose potential feature additions or modifications to increase overall satisfaction


By achieving these objectives, we aim to gain a comprehensive understanding of our current market position, identify immediate improvement opportunities, and lay the groundwork for continual product enhancement and customer satisfaction monitoring.
